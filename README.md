##  Navbar
The navbar is placed on top of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen. The image I have chosen is representative of the site's theme and incorporates the colour palette, it immediately encourages the user to think of being on holiday and entices them to read further.

## HTML and CSS Validation

I validated both my HTML and CSS code multiple times whilst building the website, I did this so that there were not a huge amount of errors/warnings at the final stages of development for me to deal with. This allowed me to incrementally improve my code and upon completion, there were 0 errors found.
