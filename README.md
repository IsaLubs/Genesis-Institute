## Deployment

I deployed this website by using GitPages and following the below steps:

GitHub pages deployment

1. Log in to GitHub
2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click 'Settings'
4. Select 'Pages' on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
5. In the source section, select branch 'Main' and save
6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following:
<img src="assets/images/snapfive.png">
Please note it can take a while for this link to become fully active.

Forking the GitHub Repository

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

Cloning the GitHub Repository

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.
